Hello! Welcome to the repositories of mine!

My name is Muhamad Aditia Wsa, I graduated from Universitas Gadjah Mada with degree in Engineering Physics
My expertise are in: 
- Design and build of system sensor;
- Developing Arduino and RaspberryPi projects;
- Data visualization using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib;
- Desktop App development using Tkinter;
- Simple single page landing using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and Javascript; and many more.

This github repository contains several of my projects, including SiBatri -an app desktop that's significantly simplifies the steps of bathymetric survey-.
